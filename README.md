# better_endgame_loot
Minecraft Datapack that enhances some of the endgame challenges with better loot tables. Updated for version 1.20.4.

## End Cities
Adds a lot of new overenchanted and otherwise impossible tools, weapons, and armor.  There is also a chance to get music discs and netherite scrap!

## Ancient Cities
Added a rare OP set of leggings to ancient city chests.

## Ocean Monuments
The elder guardian now has a 1 in 3 chance to drop an impossible helmet, and a 1 in 6 chance to drop a very cool trident.

## Woodland Mansions
Mansion loot chests may now contain a spawn egg for a very special villager, and a unique impossible crossbow.
